# Online Pixel Font Creator

A tool for creating, editing and exporting pixel fonts within the browser.

This tool is inspired by [YellowAfterLife's](https://yal.cc) [excellent tool for converting images into pixel fonts](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/pixelfont).
The font creation process using YellowAfterLife's tool has some downsides, which resolve around the need to put all of the glyphs into one growing image:

- Growing the image horizontally is tricky, as suddenly you'll end up with `Ð«` next to `G`, which makes further organization harder.
- Growing the image vertically has the consequence of ending up with an image that is hard to navigate around in an image editor.
- You need to think about where each glyph will be in the image; if you sporadically add glyphs that you need, then you might forget where you put them (and you end up with a mess like [unicode's double-struck characters](https://altcodeunicode.com/alt-codes-math-symbols-double-struck-letters/))
- The have to alternate between editing the font in an image editor and the converter to preview the font

This tool was thus created to remove the need to lay out glyphs in a 2D image and to alternate between two programs.
It features:

- controls close to [Krita](https://krita.org)'s
- visual guides for the different spacing options
- saving in the browser using `localStorage` and locally using a simple file format
- exporting to `OTF` (`TTF` to come), with an efficient path generation algorithm (TODO: flag to allow/disallow self-intersection)
- built-in preview of the glyphs

*Note: The source code is still quite messy, sorry for that.*

## TODO

- rectangle mode
- tooltips everywhere
- re-do the controls of the preview canvas
- more upload options and more export options
- support ligatures
- document the UI
